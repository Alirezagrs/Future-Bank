# Makefile
### The way to define allias for long commands, running them with a short command ==> !!! GNU Make must be installed!!!

### what is .PHONY? => always run the command for example you have:
    makefile
    main:
        pip install django
### If you have had a file like main.py in our project makefile thinks you mean main.py then does nothing. with .PHONY we make it accurate.
